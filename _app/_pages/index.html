      üêç Python Not Boring

    <h2 class="sub-title">Yet Another Python Course.</h2>

    <small>ver. <b class="amsf-version">2021.2</b>&#x30FB;by <a href="https://github.com/tiulpin">@tiulpin</a>

      Python is an interpreted, high-level, and universal programming language. It‚Äôs design philosophy emphasizes code readability and ease of implementation.
    </small>
    <small>
      According to the study The State of the Octoverse in 2020 Python overtook Java in popularity and came in second place in the top most used programming languages on GitHub.
    </small>
    <small>
      Python is used in products by companies such as:
    </small>
    <small><ul>
      <li>Google</li>
      <li>Facebook</li>
      <li>Spotify</li>
      <li>JetBrains</li>
    </ul></small>
    <small>
      They say that Python can **only** be used as a tool for writing small scripts, prototyping machine learning models, and creating autotests. However, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2020/">this is not true</a>, and the goal of the course is to show how Python is applied to a wide range of tasks in development - and it‚Äôs not necessarily something related to ML or testing.</small>
    <small>This is the second version of the course, the last time it was done in 2021.</small>
